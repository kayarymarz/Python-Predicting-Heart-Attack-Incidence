# Python Project: Predicting Heart Attack Incidence

Built a logistic regression machine learning model to predict heart attack incidence using clinical patient data with 85% accuracy. Made comparisons to a random forest model, with a 75% accuracy using 600 trees. Variable analysis showed resting heart rate as a significant predictor which confirmed initial EDA, data and hypothesis testing findings.


DESCRIPTION:

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner.
