# Python-Predicting-Heart-Attack-Incidence
Built a logistic regression machine learning model to predict heart attack incidence using clinical patient data with 85% accuracy. Made comparisons to a random forest model, with a 75% accuracy using 600 trees. Variable analysis showed resting heart rate as a significant predictor which confirmed initial EDA, data and hypothesis testing findings.
